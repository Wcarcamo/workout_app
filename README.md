Workout Tracker

This repo just tracks some changes I've been exploring. Wanted to build a little web application to run on my local network

1. Started with learning about flask
2. Moved to learning about react
3. Decided to write everything from scratch and using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS
4. Had a redesign of code app (responsive side navigation)
